The files of interest are noted in this README.

Python: Path planning
 - Abstracted OccupancyGrid and Spline data structures into separate files

Spline.py - contain implementation of centripetal catmull-rom splines

rrt.py - implementation of rrt algorithm as used in Assignment 2.

jps.py - Jump point search algorithm implemented

path.py - path planning module which is imported during simulation. (uses its own OccupancyGrid to prevent overlaps)

ros : Files required to run simulation (gazebo)
navigation.py - imports the python files for path planning
              - Paths are planned once and robot will follow that path (can modify for on-line planning easily)
              - contains three different controllers (PID, lead, lead-lag)
              - write tmp files to contain the deviation from the paths, planned path and actual robot path

plotError.py - uses the tmp files written by navigation.py and plot visuals



matlab : Files used to tune controllers
pid controller - uses Simulink to tune and matlab to print step response attributes
lead/lag controller - tune using matlab
